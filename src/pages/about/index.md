### Hi! I’m Nic, the creator of Cast and Burn Gaming!

### 

I had initially started this journey trying to do Let’s Plays on YouTube, however I quickly found out that doing concise rpg episodes requires a hell of a lot of time…which I just don’t have.

### 

You see, I have a full time job as a software developer and I'm a single dad to a pretty amazing little boy. Podcasting however, fits right into my life!

### 

I’m also a musician! I’ve been playing drums since I was 14 ( as of July 2019 I’ll be 33), and I’ve been singing since I figured out my own voice. I’ve been in a bunch of bands, and the intro/outro music for this show is actually from one of them!

### 

I’ve always been crazy about RPG’s ever since I first played Chrono Trigger. I was hooked so fast. I then jumped to secret of Mana, Illusion of Gaia, then a friend had FF3/FF6 and I just absolutely fell for final fantasy. It’s now the overwhelmingly main genre of game I play, and so I want to share my love of those games with all of you!
