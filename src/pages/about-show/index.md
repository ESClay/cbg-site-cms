### What's this podcast show about?!

### 

This podcast is fully dedicated to all RPG Videogames, with a specific focus on reviews.  Western RPGs, JRPGs, etc, are open for playing, and reviewing here!

### 

This show will also cover neat Topic-of-the-Day type episodes, and, whenever I've got enough time to scrounge things up, news from the RPG world!
