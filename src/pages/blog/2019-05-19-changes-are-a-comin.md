Hey guys!

It's been a week since the Mass Effect review and the feedback from that (and posting on Reddit...) has been phenomenal!

This site, however, isn't. It was great to launch the podcast, but it's a bit clunky and restrictive, especially with no direct plugins existing for my podcast host Anchor.fm, and so....!

I'm redesigning the site!

I'm a software developer, right?  So I'm taking this chance to teach myself some awesome new tech (GatsbyJS and GraphQL), and remaking the site to be more custom-made for me, faster, better and more secure.  It may (read: will) mean a slow-down in episodes coming up (next is the topic of the day on Villains, followed by a review of Mass Effect 2). But hopefully, this will set things up so that maintenance of the site is easier, and I only have to worry about making blog posts, and not figuring out how to nicely make a post/page every time I've got an episode that comes out, or having to rely on plugins just to add social buttons that I want.

I'm also looking into the idea of embedding the show's subreddit directly into a community page!

So, lots of exciting things, but it'll take a bit of time, so please bear with me!

Nic
