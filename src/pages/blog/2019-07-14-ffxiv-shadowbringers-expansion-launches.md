Hey guys!



I know, I know, people are waiting on the Mass Effect 2 review....and it's still in writing.  I promise it'll be out!  I'm simply deeply entrenched in FFXIV: Shadowbringers! 

Seriously, this expansion is flat out amazing, and I just can't get enough of it.  If you haven't given this game a try, even if it's just for this expansion's story, you owe it to yourself as an RPG fan to give it a shot!  

As always, my IGN is Elias Venutir on Gilgamesh (Aether datacenter).  You can always send me a /tell and I'll add you as a friend so we can run content together :)

Until .... later?\
Nic!
