Hey all!  

Nic here, to tell you that I've chosen to review the AMAZING world (or...universe rather!) that is MASS EFFECT! Mass Effect 1, to be exact.  Eventually there'll be 2 and 3, but I want to hit the beginning. 

I may gush a ton, so I'm sorry in advance!  I just love this game, and I know you will to! :)
